## What is web hosting?

Web hosting is a service companies provide that allows you to make your website visible and accessible. Rather than hosting your website on your own network server, you rent space on a provider’s — this ensures maximum speed, reliability and security for your website.

## How does web hosting work?

A web host provides server space to store your website’s files, images and code. These servers connect to the internet, allowing people to access your website by entering your domain name into a browser.

## Difference between web hosting and domain hosting

Domain hosting refers to managing the domain name, while web hosting provides the server space for your website files.

Domain hosting, also known as domain registration, is the process of acquiring and managing a unique domain name for your website. This domain name serves as your website’s address on the internet and allows people to access your website.

Conversely, web hosting provides server space, bandwidth, and the technical infrastructure needed to store and serve your website’s files to users. This process ensures your website loads quickly, stays secure and remains online.
